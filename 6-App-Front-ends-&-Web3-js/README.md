# Solidity: App front end and Web3 js

In this lesson, we're going to look at how to interact with your smart contract and
build a basic front-end for your DApp using a library called Web3.js.

    Note that app front-ends are written in JavaScript, not Solidity. But since the focus of this course is on Ethereum / Solidity, we're assuming you are already comfortable building websites with HTML, JavaScript (including ES6 promises), and JQuery, and will not be spending time covering the basics of those languages.

If you are not already comfortable building websites with HTML / JavaScript, you should complete a basic tutorial elsewhere before starting this lesson.
